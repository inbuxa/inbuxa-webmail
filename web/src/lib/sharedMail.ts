/**
 * Mail other people let the reader into (multi-account spec, MA-A): a group's
 * mailbox, folders someone shared, or a shared mailbox an administrator
 * assigned them to (MA-S).
 *
 * Either one arrives as another account in the session, `isPersonal: false`.
 * That alone proves nothing about mail -- the server advertises every
 * capability on any account it lists, so a colleague who shared one calendar
 * shows up with mail too. What does prove it is asking: an account whose
 * `Mailbox/get` answers with at least one mailbox has mail the reader can
 * open, and only those are offered.
 *
 * A shared mailbox needs no asking: the server marks it, as a delegation of
 * kind `sharedMailbox`, and it is mail by definition. A locked account handed
 * to the reader (AL-7) is listed by `delegation.ts` instead, and left out
 * here so it is never offered twice.
