 * app written in", and the only honest entries are the ones somebody has
 * translated. Offering a language with no strings behind it would set
 * `<html lang>` to a language the page is not in, which is worse than not
 * offering it: it stops Chrome offering to translate a page the reader cannot
 * read.
 *
 * Wanting German dates with an English interface is a real preference, and so
 * is the reverse, which is why `uiLanguage` and `locale` are separate settings
 * rather than one.
 *
 * Adding a language means adding its catalog and then adding it here, in
 * that order. RTL languages — Arabic, Hebrew, Persian — need bidi and layout
 * work well beyond strings, so they are not simply a matter of another entry.
