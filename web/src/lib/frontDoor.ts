/*
 * A sign-in proxy in front of the app (Cloudflare Access, Authentik's outpost
 * and the like) answers once its own session ends with a redirect to its login
 * page, usually on another origin. A page fetch can't follow that: it fails as
 * a network error. An installed app never recovers by itself, because it opens
 * on an app route the service worker answers from its kept copy, so nothing
 * ever navigates to the network where the proxy could show its login
 * (coffey-labs/ihasmail#47).
 *
 * So when a call to our own API fails that way, ask the server something cheap
 * without following redirects. A redirect, or a page where JSON was expected,
 * means the door is asking, and the root -- which the service worker always
 * sends to the network -- is opened for real. Once a minute at most, so a
 * proxy that keeps redirecting can't put the app in a loop.
