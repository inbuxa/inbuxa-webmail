/*
 * What the service worker cannot work out for itself.
 *
 * The worker can act on mail — see the note on `jmap()` in sw.js — but it
 * cannot read a catalog or a store. It is plain JavaScript copied into the
 * build, outside the bundle, with no i18n and no idea which mailbox is the
 * archive. Both of those are things a tab knows and can simply write down.
 *
 * So the app leaves a short briefing in the same cache it uses for every other
 * handoff, and the worker reads it when a notification arrives. Where there is
 * none, the worker offers no actions at all rather than guessing: an untitled
 * button that files mail somewhere is worse than a notification you have to
 * open.
 *
 * That means the actions appear once ihasmail has been opened since the worker
 * was installed, which is the same condition background notifications already
 * carry — a push subscription has to be renewed from a tab too.
