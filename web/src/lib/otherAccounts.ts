 * inbuxa MA-8: new mail in the accounts not in front.

 * when one rises while the app is open, a desktop notification names the
 * account, so mail for support@ isn't missed while someone works in their own.
 *
 * Only while a tab is open. A notification with the app closed needs each
 * added account's own Web Push subscription, which is still to come.
